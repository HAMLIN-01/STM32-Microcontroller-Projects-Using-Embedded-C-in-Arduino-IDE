# STM32-Microcontroller-Projects-Using-Embedded-C-in-Arduino-IDE
This repository contains various STM32 microcontroller projects programmed in Embedded C using Arduino IDE. Each project demonstrates different fundamental concepts of microcontroller programming, interfacing, and embedded system design.
# Projects Included
1.Blinking of Alternate LEDs – Alternately blinks two LEDs with a time delay.

2.Button Interface – Reads input from a push button and controls an LED.

3.Calculator – Performs basic arithmetic operations using a keypad and displays the result on an LCD.

4.DC Motor Control – Controls the speed and direction of a DC motor.

5.Keypad Interface – Reads input from a 4x4 keypad for user input applications.

6.LCD Display – Displays text or numbers on a 16x2 LCD.

7.Servo Motor Control – Controls a servo motor’s angle using PWM signals.

8.Seven-Segment Display – Displays numbers on a 7-segment display.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: STM32 (STM32F103),
Programming Language: Embedded C,
IDE: Arduino IDE (with STM32 support)
# How It Works
Each project is implemented using STM32 GPIO, timers, UART, PWM, and other peripherals. The code is structured for easy understanding and modification. These examples serve as a starting point for STM32-based embedded applications.
